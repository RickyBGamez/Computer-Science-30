# Computer Science 30 Assignments
Assignments I created during my time in Computer Science 30, with all of these assignments getting 100%

>As a fair notice, these are from over 2 1/2 years ago, and haven't been maintained or anything since then. Also, I'm not aware if they're the fully up to date versions, as it seems like they have some minor bugs from my testing, thus leading me to believe I never copied over the fully latest versions from my dead HDD. Anyways, they're just minor bugs that if you really wanted to use this code or learn from, it should only take you a few minutes to fix the tiny bugs. As a note, since these assignments were for a class, we had specifics and didn't require specific items. Thus sometimes you might not see an error catch, or whatever, it's due to the fact we didn't require them. I'm just releasing this code, in the hopes of increasing my portfolio. Starting with older working, slowly posting newer work. (These were created in maybe the 2nd year of me programming Java, primarily self-taught. Didn't really pay attention in class, cause I knew on how to do most of this myself, and the teacher was aware of this.)

No, I didn't use RickyBGamez as the actual name when I handed these projects in. I just changed it for GitHub.

I might update and fix them to be fully functional down the road, if I do, I'll leave a notice below this but it's highly unlikely I will since I don't really have a use for this code anymore. Just releasing it to start building my portfolio.
